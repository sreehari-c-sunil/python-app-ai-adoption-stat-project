        <li>Practical observations and documentation</li>
        <li>Tool testing and evaluation</li>
        <li>Data-driven decision making</li>
        <li>Honest statistical evaluation with transparent limitations</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="learn-card">
    <h2>Limitations and Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Statistical significance does not imply causation</li>
